Dear Parents,

At Endeavour Primary, we believe in developing our students holistically and we use the CAMPS domains to plan our school programmes and activities.

These 5 student outcomes are for our Values-based Holistic Programme and to further strengthen these outcomes, we have our LLP (Learning for Life Programme) which is “Every Child a Performer” and our ALP (Applied Learning Programme) which is “Nurturing Thinking”.

“Every Child a Performer” gives our students the opportunity to build up their self-confidence, enhance team collaboration and class spirit, put their creativity to the test by giving them platforms to perform in front of the school and parents during our key school events such as Rainbow Days and P6 Graduation Day.  Their performance, which can be a drama or a dance or a combination of various performing arts, also helps them to be more aesthetically attuned.

“Nurturing Thinking” provides platforms for our students to achieve the following outcomes:

1.  Deepen their sense of purpose in learning by relating what they learn to authentic situations;
2.  Use learner-centred pedagogies to help themselves to become more self-directed and collaborative learns;
3.  Increase their sense of ownership of their own learning where they discover, generate ideas, think critically and creatively, make decisions, evaluate and reflect.

We are proud of our brand of holistic education and we are confident that your child will grow up to be a self-directed and confident learner, and who is able to contribute effectively to society.  Endeavour all the way!

Mr Thomas Koh

Principal
