Dear Parents,

Listed are some of the common issues with SLS that you may encounter. (_Updated 13 April, 2020_)

**Issue: Students are unable to log in to SLS, even though they have entered the correct username and password.**  
Reason:  
Because of security concerns, users using IE or Safari version 10 (and older versions) will not be able to login to SLS. A detailed list of browsers that are supported can be found [here.](/singapore-student-learning-space-sls/)

**Issue: When attempting audio response questions, students using the iPad are unable to do audio recording.**  
Reason:  
iPad currently does not support the audio recording library that SLS uses. The SLS team is currently working with Apple to resolve this issue. In the meantime, our teachers are encouraged to change the question type from audio response to free response for future assignments, which allows students to upload and submit an audio file. The students can use a voice-recording app to do their recording and then upload their audio clip to SLS.

**Issue: Text entered by students are not properly displayed, when accessing SLS from their mobile phones.**  
Reason:  
The current SLS version is not supported on mobile devices. We hope to release an SLS mobile version soon. (Please note that when it says not supported on mobile devices, viewing and some functions may not be fully optimized, not as in entirely cannot use.)

Please click [here](/singapore-student-learning-space-sls/) for the technical requirements for optimized devices to access SLS.

_We will update this page as we get updates from the SLS Team. Thank you for your patience._
