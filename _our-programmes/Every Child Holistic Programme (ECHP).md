In fulfilling our school’s mission,&nbsp;**“To provide a unique schooling experience to develop in every child Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social domains”**, we have embarked on the Every Child Holistic Programme (ECHP) since 2008.

Under&nbsp;**ECHP, the Every Child an Artist (ECAA)**&nbsp;programme and&nbsp;**Every Child a Performer (ECAP)**&nbsp;programme were implemented to&nbsp;**support the development of the Aesthetics domain.**

The Every Child Holistic Programme (ECHP) seeks to bring out the latent potential in our pupils. School is not just about performing well in the examinations. We also want to develop the students holistically in Cognitive, Aesthetic, Moral, Physical and Social (CAMPS) aspects.

In Endeavour, we want every child to be a&nbsp;**Leader,**&nbsp;a&nbsp;**Performer**, a&nbsp;**Sportsperson**, a&nbsp;**Thinker**, a&nbsp;**Responsible Citizen**, an&nbsp;**Artist**&nbsp;and a&nbsp;**Writer**&nbsp;and the ECHP supports this.

All our students are given leadership roles and tasks to fulfil. We monitor their leadership capabilities and train them to be more effective and caring leaders. The students’ performance is assessed by their teachers and recorded in their Holistic Development Profile.

Every term, the school sets aside a special day, Rainbow Day, for students to showcase their talents. This will help build their self-confidence and courage in performing in front of large audiences. Parents are invited to view their performance. Students come to school in clothes of their choice and this adds to the gaiety of the events.

All our students participate in Sports Day and represent their class for various events.&nbsp; They learn the values of Sportsmanship and also about the importance of class spirit and teamwork.

Our ALP is “Nurturing Thinking”. Through this ALP, we hope to achieve the following desired 21CC and learning outcomes:

**1\. Deepen students’ sense of purpose in learning by relating what they learn to authentic situations**

**2\. Use Learner-centred pedagogies to help students become self-directed and collaborative learners**&nbsp;

**3\. Increase student ownership where students discover, generate ideas, think critically, make decisions, evaluate and self-reflect**

We involve every child actively in the Values In Action Programme (VIA),&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programme and National Education (NE) Programme. We believe our students should do their part for the nation and community.

The school believes that every child is capable of producing a good piece of artwork. Each child’s artwork is displayed around the school and on the school’s Art blog.

Every child has his or her writing compiled in booklets and uploaded onto our school website. The pupils can read their essays online as well as those of the other classes. We hope they can become confident writers with a sense of pride in their writing.
