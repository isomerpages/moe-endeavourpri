In 2011, the school embarked on a programme called Endeavour Programme for Active Learning (EPAL). The activities are categorised under four broad domains namely: Sports and Games, Performing Arts, Outdoor education and Visual Arts. During EPAL, Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils are provided with opportunities to engage in meaningful activities to learn new and exciting skills which will benefit them in their future.

In 2012, Endeavour Primary School will be one of the selected schools embarking on Programme for Active Learning (PAL).
