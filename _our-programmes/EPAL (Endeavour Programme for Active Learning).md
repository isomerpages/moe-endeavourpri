In 2011, the school embarked on a programme called Endeavour Programme for Active Learning (EPAL). The activities are categorised under four broad domains namely: Sports and Games, Performing Arts, Outdoor education and Visual Arts. During EPAL, Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils are provided with opportunities to engage in meaningful activities to learn new and exciting skills which will benefit them in their future.
