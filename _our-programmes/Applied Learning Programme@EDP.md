Nurturing Thinking
------------------
In Endeavour Primary School, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) â€“ Nurturing Thinking focuses on developing students to foster adaptive and inventive thinking as well as effective communication skills through interdisciplinary experiences.

In addition to the use of thinking routines to provide them with thinking opportunities in their day-to-day learning, students embark on learning experiences through the 5-stage design thinking process. This encourages students to develop empathy and a growth mindset, while fostering creativity and innovation.

Students from primary 1 to 3 go through various activities to explore the design thinking process. Through these activities, students learn to develop empathy for living things, learn to ideate and create a prototype. Below are some of the projects created by our students.

Students in the primary 4 to 6 levels will apply the design thinking process to solve real world challenges related to sustainability and/or the community. These include our PlayMakers programme where students design and create objects using Strawbees and recycled items and also our music and animation programme where students apply skills acquired from different subjects (e.g. EL, Science, Music and Art) to create their own digital music and stop-motion animation to promote sustainability or address a sustainability related issue.
