In fulfilling our school’s mission, “To provide a unique schooling experience to develop in every child Cognitive, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social domains”, we have embarked on the **Every Child Holistic Programme (ECHP)** since 2008.

Under ECHP, the Every Child an Artist (ECAA) programme and **Every Child a Performer (ECAP)** programme were implemented to support the development of the Aesthetics domain.
