### **KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN ENDEAVOUR VISUAL ARTS**

To cater to diverse student needs, talents and interests, our Art department focuses on offering students flexibility and choice as well as exposure to different art forms. The modular curriculum encourages students to build on strong fundamental skills and to explore material play through the Drawing and Painting; Printmaking; Digital Art and 3-Dimensional Modelling modules.

In addition, thinking routines are infused into the art curriculum to encourage students to generate and build on one another’s ideas, make their thinking visible, and be assessors of their own and peers’ learning. Inquiry-based learning in and through Art nurtures our students to be curious, confident and cooperative learners.

### **EDP PRIMARY FIVE EVERY-CHILD-AN-ARTIST PROGRAMME**

The Every-Child-Holistic-Programme seeks to bring out the latent potential in our students. In Visual Art, this is developed through our Every-Child-an-Artist (ECAA) programme.

Encouraging questioning & investigating is key to developing an inquiring mind in the students. Our Primary Five students work on a given theme with their art teachers, where they unfold their thinking and interpretation during art discussions and material play, generating ideas and experimenting with an array of materials and techniques to create their masterpieces.

The artworks and documentation of their learning are showcased at Endeavour Art Gallery during the annual Primary Five Every-Child-an-Artist Exhibition. Selected Primary Five student-artists take on the role of art ambassadors to share their class’s exhibition-in-curriculum journey with the audience.

Gallery tour is also facilitated for our Primary One to Primary Six students to appreciate the artworks and thinking of these student-artists. This student-curated P5ECAA exhibition invites the audience to take on the role of an artist by making visible their responses to the artworks and art-making processes showcased. The exhibition becomes a living narrative where artworks are alive and changing with audience’s active participation. Every child is an artist, so is the audience.

Here’s a snapshot of one of our P5ECAA Exhibitions – ‘Magical Wonderland @EDP’.

### **EDP COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THROUGH ART PROGRAMME**

To nurture in our students a strong sense of civic responsibility, we collaborate with our community partners to provide beyond school experiences for our students to play an active part in community service when the opportunity arises.

As part of this Community Engagement through Art programme in collaboration with iLight Marina Bay 2017, a total of our 185 Primary Three, Primary Five and Primary Six students learnt to transform recycled bottles into one of the key light installations featured at the launch of iLight Art Festival 2017, titled ‘Ocean Pavilion’.

Through this collaboration, our students contributed in a small way to advocate care for the environment by reusing and upcycling bottles to create aesthetically beautiful artworks that can be enjoyed by many. A pre-assembly talk was also presented by these young artists to share this community engagement initiative with their peers in school to inculcate a greater awareness about care for the environment.

### **EDP Artnews: Primary Six Notan Art Exhibition Goes Virtual During HBL!**

The shift to full home-based learning during circuit breaker due to COVID-19 provided a canvas for teachers to innovate, inculcate independence in learning, and ignite students’ curiosity. 

Our Primary Six students were introduced to a new art concept known as Notan which explores different arrangements of light and dark elements. Part of this new learning involved a Share-A-Praise component to encourage students to appreciate their peers’ artworks. Pushing for learning beyond the formal curriculum, our art teacher (Madam Hajjar) hosted her students’ artworks on a virtual art space to showcase their art-making to the audience beyond their own classes. This virtual gallery was subsequently extended to include the showcase of Notan artworks from all our Primary Six classes.

Welcome to our online Endeavour Art Gallery! Walk virtually through the virtual art exhibition that features the Notan artworks from our Primary Six artists. Enjoy the self-guided tour!
