##### **_Overview_**

The PE Programme aims to develop students’ psychomotor and games skills, equip them with the knowledge, and attitudes to pursue and enjoy a physically active and healthy lifestyle.

Students develop and maintain physical health and fitness through regular participation in physical activities and acquire safe practices during physical activities. They also demonstrate the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship.

##### **_Approach_**

Teachers adopt Experiential Learning pedagogy in the teaching of PE. Teachers also use Movement Education to encourage the learning of basic and generic skills such as fundamental movement skills, dance and gymnastics. Through Movement Education, the students learn through experiences and construct their own understanding, instead of being told. In addition, they acquire a variety of manipulative skill sets required for gameplay through engaging activities and modified games.

Stuednts’ physical abilities are further developed through play in modified games settings. The Games Concept Approach (GCA) pedagogy is used to teach performance skills and tactics in modified games. As students play and experience authentic problem-solving situations, they get to be fully engaged in physical, cognitive and social challenges that promote their holistic learning.

##### _**Sports Enrichment Programmes for Primary 4 and Primary 5 (SEP)**_

The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage sports participation and increase sporting opportunities for the students. Sports programmes under SEP should cater for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help promote active participation of sports in schools. These programmes promote team spirit and character building, and arouse interest in continual sports participation amongst students.

##### **_Primary 5 Camp Resilience_**

Upper primary years are important years to increase the confidence and self-belief of the students. The aim of the camp is also to allow the teachers and students to build strong relationships and promote class bonding through its activities.
