<h3><strong>SUPER AUSTRA</strong></h3>
<p>Research has shown that only a small percentage of children are confident
in solving word problems. At EDP, we believe that every child is a problem
solver.</p>
<p>With that belief, we have created a superhero icon, SUPER AUSTRA, to help
build our students’ problem-solving skills in a structured approach.&nbsp;Students
will be equipped with ‘attacking’ skills to solve word problems. They will
also learn how to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of their answers.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-on Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance the understanding and mastery of Mathematics concepts, our
students have many opportunities to work with concrete manipulatives. Students
will relate the concepts to everyday things around them so that they can
appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in their daily lives. In this way,
the learning of Mathematics becomes more meaningful and authentic. Students
also learn to make their thinking more visible by explaining how they solve
mathematical problems.</p>

<p><strong>Factual Fluency Champions</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that a strong foundation in basic Mathematics facts is crucial
in the development of conceptual understanding, skills and attitudes in
our students.&nbsp; The Number Bonds Champion badge and the Multiplication
Champion badge are examples of badges designed to motivate our young learners
in mastering the facts.&nbsp; Our teachers help our students gain this
fluency through interesting games, practices and iPad apps during their
Mathematics lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive Math Exchange Zone (IMEZ) @ EDP</strong>
</p>
<p>IMEZ @ EDP was created to provide students with a space to hone their
problem-solving skills through various interactive games. Students get
to play Mathematics games on the iPads provided as well as challenge themselves
and their schoolmates via puzzles in a fun manner. These games are carefully
chosen to enhance higher-order thinking skills such as logical thinking,
sequential thinking and spatial visualisation. Through playing these games,
our students also learn to develop turn-taking skills and values such as
perseverance.</p>

<h3><strong>Math Olympiad Enrichment Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Primary 4 and 5 students who display an aptitude for and an interest in
Mathematics are invited to participate in the school’s Math Olympiad enrichment
programme. &nbsp;Through this programme, students are challenged to develop
higher-order thinking skills via a wider repertoire of problem-solving
tools.&nbsp; Students are also given opportunities to pit their wits against
the best through Math Olympiad and inter-school Mathematics competitions.</p>
