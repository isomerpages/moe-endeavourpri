### **SUPER AUSTRA**

Research has shown that only a small percentage of children are confident in solving word problems. At EDP, we believe that every child is a problem solver.

With that belief, we have created a superhero icon, SUPER AUSTRA, to help build our students’ problem-solving skills in a structured approach. Students will be equipped with ‘attacking’ skills to solve word problems. They will also learn how to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of their answers.

**Hands-on Learning Experiences**

To enhance the understanding and mastery of Mathematics concepts, our students have many opportunities to work with concrete manipulatives. Students will relate the concepts to everyday things around them so that they can appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in their daily lives. In this way, the learning of Mathematics becomes more meaningful and authentic. Students also learn to make their thinking more visible by explaining how they solve mathematical problems.

**Factual Fluency Champions**

We believe that a strong foundation in basic Mathematics facts is crucial in the development of conceptual understanding, skills and attitudes in our students.  The Number Bonds Champion badge and the Multiplication Champion badge are examples of badges designed to motivate our young learners in mastering the facts.  Our teachers help our students gain this fluency through interesting games, practices and iPad apps during their Mathematics lessons.

**Interactive Math Exchange Zone (IMEZ) @ EDP**

IMEZ @ EDP was created to provide students with a space to hone their problem-solving skills through various interactive games. Students get to play Mathematics games on the iPads provided as well as challenge themselves and their schoolmates via puzzles in a fun manner. These games are carefully chosen to enhance higher-order thinking skills such as logical thinking, sequential thinking and spatial visualisation. Through playing these games, our students also learn to develop turn-taking skills and values such as perseverance.

### **Math Olympiad Enrichment Programme**

Primary 4 and 5 students who display an aptitude for and an interest in Mathematics are invited to participate in the school’s Math Olympiad enrichment programme.  Through this programme, students are challenged to develop higher-order thinking skills via a wider repertoire of problem-solving tools.  Students are also given opportunities to pit their wits against the best through Math Olympiad and inter-school Mathematics competitions.

### **Competitions**

Other than the school-based Tangrams and Sudoku competitions, students with strong logical thinking skills are invited to participate in external competitions.
