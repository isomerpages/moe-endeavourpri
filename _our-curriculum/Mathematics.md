<h3><strong>Mathematical Growth Mindset @ EDP</strong></h3>

</div>
<p>Our school fosters a mathematical growth mindset in students by shifting
the focus from rote memorization of mathematical concepts to deep conceptual
understanding and problem-solving. This approach involves creating a safe
environment where mistakes are viewed as valuable learning opportunities,
encouraging students to persevere on when managing challenging tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers employ strategies such as praising effort over innate ability.
“Yet" statements are used to reinforce the belief that everyone can learn
Mathematics and that abilities can be developed over time. Students also
receive constructive feedback aimed at enhancing their learning progress
in Mathematics.</p>
<p>During Mathematics lessons, students are encouraged to talk about, explain
and reflect on their thinking processes through meaningful, open-ended
activities. This emphasis on metacognition helps build their awareness
of their own learning and strengthens their problem-solving skills. Opportunities
are provided to explore alternative problem-solving methods too.</p>
<p>Through these conscious efforts, students are empowered to embrace challenges,
learn from setbacks and believe in their potential to excel in Mathematics.</p>
<h3><strong>SUPER AUSTRA</strong></h3>
<p>Research has shown that only a small percentage of children are confident
in solving word problems. At EDP, we believe that every child is a problem
solver.</p>
<p>With that belief, we have created a superhero icon, SUPER AUSTRA, to help
build our students’ problem-solving skills in a structured approach.&nbsp;Students
will be equipped with ‘attacking’ skills to solve word problems. They will
also learn how to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of their answers.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-on Learning Experiences (EDPlay)</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance the understanding and mastery of Mathematics concepts, our
students have many opportunities to work with concrete manipulatives. Students
will relate the concepts to everyday things around them so that they can
appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in their daily lives. In this way,
the learning of Mathematics becomes more meaningful and authentic. Students
also learn to make their thinking more visible by explaining how they solve
mathematical problems.</p>

<p><strong>Factual Fluency Champions</strong>
</p>
<p>A strong foundation in basic Mathematics facts is crucial in the development
of conceptual understanding, skills and attitudes in students. The Number
Bonds Champion badge and the Multiplication Champion badge are examples
of badges designed to motivate young learners in mastering the facts.&nbsp;
Our teachers help students gain this factual fluency through interesting
games, practices and iPad apps during Mathematics lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning support is provided for students who need additional support
in developing basic numeracy skills. The programme is conducted by trained
teachers in small groups during curriculum time, ensuring that each student
receives individual attention.</p>
<p>Students are identified at the start of Primary 1 to join the programme
and the support may continue up to Primary 4 if needed to help them lay
a strong foundation in Mathematics.</p>
<h3><strong>Maths Excellence 2000 (E2K)</strong></h3>
<p>Primary 4 and 5 students who demonstrate a strong aptitude and interest
in Mathematics are invited to participate in the school’s Mathematics Excellence
2000 (Maths E2K) programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This inquiry-based enrichment programme aims to nurture in students 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies such as critical and inventive thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through engaging activities such as stories, games and puzzles, students
get to explore different mathematical concepts and sharpen their problem-solving
abilities. The collaborative nature of the programme also encourages them
to learn to express their thinking clearly and work effectively with their
peers.</p>

<h3><strong>Math Olympiad Enrichment Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Primary 4 and 5 students who display an aptitude for and an interest in
Mathematics are invited to participate in the school’s Math Olympiad enrichment
programme. &nbsp;Through this programme, students are challenged to develop
higher-order thinking skills via a wider repertoire of problem-solving
tools.&nbsp; Students are also given opportunities to pit their wits against
the best through Math Olympiad and inter-school Mathematics competitions.</p>
