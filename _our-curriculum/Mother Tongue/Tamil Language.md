We believe in the joy of reading; we want our students to cultivate the habit of reading from young. Our ‘Let’s love reading’ programme has a wide range of reading activities both in class and beyond. It enables the students to read extensively and develop the love for Tamil Language and instil the habit of life-long reading.
