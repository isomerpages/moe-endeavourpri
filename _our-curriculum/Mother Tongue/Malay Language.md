As part of our school base curriculum innovation, we have infused Thinking Routines in our Malay language teaching and learning. Pupils are geared towards a holistic education to develop enterprising, creative, caring and civic-minded individuals. It had provided teachers with the opportunity to act as facilitators in developing the three core 21st century competencies i.e cooperation, curiosity and confidence.

EDP ML Programme includes the Shared Book Approach (SBA) and Differentiated Instructions (DI) as its two main approaches in effectively engaging teachers and students alike in the teaching and learning of Malay Language.  
We consciously put in place authentic learning in the classroom as it brings into play multiple disciplines, multiple perspectives, ways of working and habits of the mind.

### **MOTHER TONGUE FORTNIGHT WEEK ACTIVITIES**

Pupils are exposed to the various Malay traditional art, games and food during our yearly Mother Tongue week. They learn to appreciate and understand the culture deeper by engaging themselves in the activities planned. It enables the pupils to use Malay Language and imbue the right culture and values.
