毅勤小学华文部致力于落实教育部母语课程的三大目标，即在发展学生听、说、读、写、口语互动和书面互动等语言能力的同时，兼顾人文素养和通用能力的培养。我们希望通过开展多元化的教学活动，以及举办一系列与华族语言文化相关的活动，鼓励孩子在生活中使用华文，让他们亲近华族文化，实现“乐学善用”的教学理念。

The Mother Tongue Department (Chinese Language) seeks to realise the key goals of Mother Tongue language syllabus, that is to develop in our pupils the 4 basic language skills, spoken and written interaction skills, as well as the 21st century competencies through a variety of classroom activities. In addition, pupils will also be given exposure to Chinese culture and values through various level and school-wide programmes so as to better understand and appreciate the culture. Ultimately, we hope our pupils will experience joy in learning Chinese and use the language confidently in everyday lives.

<strong style="color: blue;">母语双周 Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
<br>
通过母语双周活动，学生对中华传统文化艺术或传统语言游戏有基本的认识。他们除了了解各门艺术的起源和发展外，也有机会动手制作红包灯笼、中国结等，通过实践体验活动的乐趣与增强动手创新的能力。此外，我们鼓励学生与家人一起进行活动或给家人介绍刚接触的文化艺术，以促进亲子关系，还有制造更多机会让学生在生活中用华语与人沟通。

During Mother Tongue Fortnight, opportunities are created for students to understand and explore Chinese culture through various activities. Students learn about the history of Chinese cultural arts and delve into it by observing, discussing and trying to replicate the various arts. Apart from classroom activities, the students are also encouraged to share what they have learnt or carry out the art and craft activities with their family members, which is great for bonding and promotes the use of Chinese language at home.

<strong style="color: blue;">传统节日的庆祝 Celebration of Traditional Festivals</strong>
<br>
传统节日是华族文化的重要部分，我校每年都会举办农历新年大型庆祝会，每两年举办一次中秋节庆祝晚会，让老师、学生和家长齐聚一堂一起庆祝节日。节日的庆祝让华族和外族学生对华族文化有所认识，有助于促进各族交流与了解。此外，也让家长与孩子有机会一起参加节日庆祝活动，贴近孩子的学习生活。

Traditional festivals form an important part of Chinese culture, the main festivals celebrated in our school are Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn festival. Teachers, pupils and parents come together to celebrate both festivals which provide opportunities for Chinese and non-Chinese pupils to understand Chinese culture and for parents and children to bond over festive celebrations in school.
