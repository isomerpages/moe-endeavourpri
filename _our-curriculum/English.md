**Stellar Programme**

Endeavour Primary School has implemented the national English language curriculum known as STELLAR  
(Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading). This initiative by the Ministry of Education  
has been running well in the school since 2008.

STELLAR places an emphasis on reading and enjoyment of the language. Thus, in place of English textbooks,  
prescribed thematic story books are used to teach students the skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking.  
The use of engaging stories helps to maintain the students’ interest in the language. The STELLAR Pedagogic Model  
is made up of a few major teaching strategies.

For each of these strategies, there will be a range of activities that will approach language both  
‘holistically’ as well as in parts. This is where phonics, grammar, vocabulary, spelling and punctuation  
can be taught explicitly. In this model, there is a weaving between ‘whole’ and ‘parts’ in the teaching and learning  
of English.
