<p style=";font-size: 26px; color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)</p>
CCAs play an important role in developing our students holistically. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents. Friendships are forged among peers from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. At the same time, students develop values and 21st&nbsp; Century Competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.

#### _**Talent Identification and Development Programme**_

The Talent Identification and Development Programme in EDP is part of the school’s approach to customize our CCA programme to cater to the talents and interest of our students. A Talent Identification selection exercise is conducted for all P2 students at the end of Term 2. The aims of this programme are:

*   To provide a longer runway for our talented students to pursue and excel in their area of talent and passion.
*   To expose our students to meaningful CCA experiences to discover their strength of character.
*   To provide a platform to develop in our students, the school values and school spirit.

#### _**CCA Experience@EDP**_

CCA Experience is about providing opportunities for Primary 3 students to have an experience of the various CCAs. The students will experience the selected CCAs for two weeks period before making their decision in choosing a CCA for themselves.
