<h3><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Student Learning Space and other ICT tools</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SLS Website:&nbsp;<a href="https://learning.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://learning.moe.edu.sg</a></strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture confident and active user of technology, SLS is used to complement
classroom teaching and further enrich students’ learning experience.</p>
<p>In addition, teachers may also use other ICT tools or Google apps such
as google slides and spreadsheets to conduct the lessons at the computer
laboratories or use of iPads.</p>
<h3><strong>HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hands-on Activities During Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Students engage in meaningful hands-on activities to explore and understand
scientific concepts through the Science Inquiry Approach. Our well-equipped
Science laboratories provide a safe environment for practical sessions,
where students develop critical thinking and process skills through systematic
investigation.</p>
<p>We utilise SPARKLE (Science Pack Activity Resource Kits for Learning)
kits, which are developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Science
Centre Singapore. These kits encourage students to explore and test their
scientific ideas through "hands-on, minds-on" activities. Through guided
questions and discussion alongside practical investigations, students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pose investigative questions about scientific phenomena</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan and conduct investigations using appropriate methods and tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect and analyse data to form logical conclusions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate their findings and reflect on their learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a blend of guided practical work with SPARKLE kits and teacher
demonstrations, students develop both conceptual understanding and scientific
skills. These experiential learning opportunities help nurture students'
curiosity about the natural and physical world while building their confidence
in scientific investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>SCIENTIFIC LITERACY</strong></h3>
<p>We believe in nurturing our students to become scientifically literate
individuals who can thrive in today's world. Scientific literacy goes beyond
just understanding facts – it empowers our students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Think critically about the world around them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make informed decisions based on evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate scientific ideas effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate how science impacts our daily lives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach to developing scientific literacy aligns with international
standards, including those measured by the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA). We achieve this through:</p>
<p><strong>Structured Learning Support</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've developed customised learning packages that help students master
scientific vocabulary and concepts in an age-appropriate way. Our students
learn to explain scientific phenomena clearly and confidently using proper
scientific language.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Frameworks</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using specially designed thinking frameworks like Concept-Cause and Effect,
we guide students to analyse scientific phenomena systematically. This
helps them understand the relationships between different scientific concepts
and their real-world applications.</p>
<p>Through these approaches, our students develop strong foundations in scientific
thinking and communication, preparing them for future learning and real-world
challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>ENRICHMENT AND LEARNING JOURNEY</strong></h3>
<p>We integrate environmental sustainability across our science learning
journeys, helping students understand their role in creating a greener
future. Our signature programmes include:</p>
<p><strong>Orchid Hybridisation Programme (OH! At Endeavour)</strong> Our
P5 programme combines hands-on learning with environmental stewardship.
