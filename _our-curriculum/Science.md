## Our Scientific Endeavours

### **TECHNOLOGY**

**Student Learning Space and other ICT tools**

**SLS Website: [https://learning.moe.edu.sg](https://learning.moe.edu.sg/)**

To nurture confident and active user of technology, SLS is used to complement classroom teaching and further enrich students’ learning experience.

In addition, teachers may also use other ICT tools or Google apps such as google slides and spreadsheets to conduct the lessons at the computer laboratories or use of iPads.

### **HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES**

**Performance-based assessment**

There are performance-based assignments for different levels which provide opportunities for students to reinforce what they have learnt collaboratively. Below is a summary of the assignments for various levels.

**Hands-on activities during lessons**

Students have many opportunities to explore scientific concepts through hands-on activities. The practical sessions which are conducted mostly at the Science laboratories are safe for all students to carry out. Teachers generally use the 5E approach (Engage – Explore – Explain- Elaborate – evaluate ) to conduct inquiry-based learning. Sometimes, the teacher will carry out a class demonstration for selected activities.

### **SCIENTIFIC LITERACY**

In Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study, Scientific Literacy is defined as the ability to understand the characteristics of science and the significance of science in our modern world, to apply scientific knowledge, identify issues, describe scientific phenomena, draw conclusions based on evidence, and the willingness to reflect on and engage with scientific ideas and subjects. (_source from_ [_https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy_](https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy/)[_/_](https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy/) _)_.

Students need to acquire the language of Science to be specific in their scientific explanations. Thus, customised packages and thinking frame (Concept- Cause and Effect) are developed for specific topics to provide students with the language to understand and explain scientific phenomena.

### **ENRICHMENT AND LEARNING JOURNEY**

The learning of Science takes place beyond the classrooms and school where students’ curiosity about our world of living things is stimulated through experiential learning journeys. Science Learning Journeys reinforce or extend students’ learning of Science in school. More details will be finalised by the respective Science teachers.
