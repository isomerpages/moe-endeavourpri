## Vision

Every Child A Scientist

## Mission

To nurture curious and active learners through inquiry-based learning and develop their scientific skills for life-long learning.

## Our Scientific Endeavours

![Our Scientific Endeavours](/images/Our-scientific-endeavours.png)

### **TECHNOLOGY**

**Student Learning Space and other ICT tools**

**SLS Website: [https://learning.moe.edu.sg](https://learning.moe.edu.sg/)**

To nurture confident and active user of technology, SLS is used to complement classroom teaching and further enrich students’ learning experience.

In addition, teachers may also use other ICT tools or Google apps such as google slides and spreadsheets to conduct the lessons at the computer laboratories or use of iPads.

### **HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES**

**Performance-based assessment**

There are performance-based assignments for different levels which provide opportunities for students to reinforce what they have learnt collaboratively. Below is a summary of the assignments for various levels.

![Performance-based assessment](/images/Performance-based-assessment-chart.jpg)

**Hands-on activities during lessons**

Students have many opportunities to explore scientific concepts through hands-on activities. The practical sessions which are conducted mostly at the Science laboratories are safe for all students to carry out. Teachers generally use the 5E approach (Engage – Explore – Explain- Elaborate – evaluate ) to conduct inquiry-based learning. Sometimes, the teacher will carry out a class demonstration for selected activities.

### **SCIENTIFIC LITERACY**

In Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study, Scientific Literacy is defined as the ability to understand the characteristics of science and the significance of science in our modern world, to apply scientific knowledge, identify issues, describe scientific phenomena, draw conclusions based on evidence, and the willingness to reflect on and engage with scientific ideas and subjects. (_source from_ [_https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy_](https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy/)[_/_](https://www.pisa.tum.de/en/domains/scientific-literacy/) _)_.

Students need to acquire the language of Science to be specific in their scientific explanations. Thus, customised packages and thinking frame (Concept- Cause and Effect) are developed for specific topics to provide students with the language to understand and explain scientific phenomena.

### **ENRICHMENT AND LEARNING JOURNEY**

The learning of Science takes place beyond the classrooms and school where students’ curiosity about our world of living things is stimulated through experiential learning journeys. Science Learning Journeys reinforce or extend students’ learning of Science in school. More details will be finalised by the respective Science teachers.

![Table Learning Journey and Enrichment](/images/Table_Learning-Journey-and-Enrichment.jpg)
Do note that the above Learning Journeys/enrichment programmes are subjected to changes every year. Unless stated otherwise, the programmes are conducted after curriculum hours

**OH! At Endeavour (Orchid Hybridisation! @ Endeavour)**

P5 students learn about the pollination, the genetics of hybridisation and techniques of aseptic tissue culture through hands-on lessons. The creation of new hybrids will be a testament to how our students improve and innovate on existing breeds of orchids. In addition, students will learn the proper ways to take care of orchids and have the opportunity to monitor the growth of orchids in our school.

In line with the P5 Science topic on the Reproduction of Flowering Plants, students go through one session of Orchid Hybridisation Enrichment Lesson conducted by Orchidville. The objective of the workshop is to impart students higher order skills (HOTS) through involving them in the growing, selection and creation of hybrids and registration of Orchid hybrids.

At the end of the lessons, students would have learnt to:

*   Understand life cycle and reproduction of flowering plant in general.
*   Identify the male and female parts of an orchid flower.
*   Recognise pollination and fertilization in flowering plants using orchids as learning subject.
*   State the conditions necessary for germination of orchids.
*   Learn interesting facts and craft activity involving orchids

Through our P5 Orchid Hybridisation programme, we have been able to successfully create and our very own orchid hybrid: _Guarvolclia_ Miss Endeavour. This orchid was registered in year 2018 and launched during the EDP10 Homecoming Carnival.

### **ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION**

**Eco-guardians**

Endeavour’s Eco-guardians are the green ambassadors from the P4 to P6 classes who are committed in motivating others in moving towards a more sustainable environment. They undergo training sessions and workshops to better understand their roles, assigned duties and how to go about carrying out their responsibilities.

Our Eco-guardians will have their first meeting and training session in January every year. During this training session, they will be briefed on their duties for the year, and also a familiarisation section on our gardens

For the subsequent meet-up sessions with the eco-guardians, there will be interesting and relevant workshops conducted for them. They will continue to learn how to grow different crops using different mediums and the importance of reducing food waste. In addition, they are also creating online resources for the school to impact more students.

In April 2022, the eco-guardians harvested and donated about 4kg of vegetables to Sembawang GRC for the Gardens Give Back programme. Also, the eco-guardians also have the opportunities to participate in other programmes organized by Northwest CDC, such as Reduce@Northwest programme in 2022.

**Green wave**

In Endeavour, we believe in educating our students the importance of protecting our natural environment and biodiversity. Thus, we participate in the Green Wave to educate our students the need to keep Singapore green and vibrant.

### **OUTDOOR LEARNING**

**Eco-garden**

The following learning stations can be found at the eco-garden:

1.  Aquarium
2.  Orchid Shed
3.  Insect enclosure
4.  The Eco-Pond and the aquatic plants
5.  The Fern Paradise
6.  The Leaf Litter and Rotting log
7.  The Spice and Herbs (for volunteers only)
8.  The Wormery
9.  The flowering plants
10.  Grow your own plant corner (Eco-guardians only)
11.  Fruit Tree trail

![Eco-garden](/images/eco-garden-768x432.png)

The eco-garden stimulates the curiosity of students and provides a space and opportunity for Science exploration while creating an awareness of our need to conserve.

The spice and herbs are grown in planters by some of the upper block students. They are students who volunteer to adopt and take care of the plants in the planters. In addition, some students will have the opportunities to germinate different seeds and grow them in the garden as well. Eco-guardians also get the opportunity to adopt and grow their own plant at a designated area.

Beside the eco-guardians on duty, some students will also have the opportunities to feed the aquatic animals during their recess.

**Aquatic Learning Corner (ALeZ)**

ALeZ was constructed at the last quarter of the year 2016. It is an experiential area for the learning of Life Sciences, in particular, aquatic living organisms and their habitats. There are two tanks, namely, Terrarium tank and Aquatic Fishes and Plant Tank. Both tanks will provide a platform to enable students to appreciate the diversity of living organisms through observation of the freshwater plants and animals in the aquariums.

In addition, Science lessons will be conducted at ALeZ to deepen class discussions in the relevant topics in the Science Syllabus from P3 to P6.

![Students can also participate in the termly quiz found at the Notice Board found beside ALeZ.](/images/alez-and-garden.jpg)

**Greenhouse**

The P3 students have the opportunity to learn and grow vegetables using the Dynamic Root Floating (DRF) technique in the greenhouse for their performance-based assessment. The students will also investigate if the growth of a plant is affected by different mediums. They will also learn how to harvest the vegetables and enjoy their produce at home!

The Eco-guardians will also be using the greenhouse to grow different crops using the different systems in it.

### **COMPETITIONS & ACHIEVEMENTS**

Students love competitions so they enjoy participating in various Science competitions organized by other schools. The Singapore Science Centre or other agencies provide our students with an opportunity to transfer their learning into action, given each competitive situation.
